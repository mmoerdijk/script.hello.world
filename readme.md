# Description

Simple service plugin that read values from a  url that returns json formated values. I used to read values from my thingspeak channel.


# Setup of the service plugin

edit service.py and fill in the thingspeak api key and the channel id variable

Add $INFO[Window(Home).Property(thingspeak)] to one of the xml (for example the home.xml) files from your skin, this will be replaced by the values from thingspeak.


# Installation of the service plugin

Launch Kodi >> Add-ons >> Get More >> .. >> Install from zip file

Feel free to ask any questions on the Kodi Forums.

Enjoy!
